Reduce the construction time from 30f to 3f for two backwalls.

12/20/2019:
Gonna make the walls replaceable, when you try to build them with different material.  

According my knowledge, ONI uses tags to classifi the objects. Her
e goes the problem, I don't know which tag does the wall use, so I can't make the wall replace speific object:itself  
Ofcourse, maybe I'm wrong, but obiviously nobody could tell me if.
I'll back later to solve it. Or, somebody helps me?
